Implementation of Time Management Unit(TMU)module based on the event driven archticure. this module has a capability to calculate different timing slots and call different user functions using Callback mechanism.
according to test the module , I have made a test application consists of three Leds ,The First One Toggle Each 50 msec , The Second one Toggles Each 100 msec and the Third One Toggles Each 150 msec , and I have attached the simulation file in the repo file and snap shot while application running.
